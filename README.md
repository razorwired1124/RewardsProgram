# RewardsProgram

### Language Used: Python
### IDE: Pycharm<br><br>

### Problem
A retailer offers a rewards program to its customers, awarding points based on each recorded purchase.<br>
A customer receives 2 points for every dollar spent over $100 in each transaction, plus 1 point for every dollar spent over $50 in each transaction (e.g. a $120 purchase = 2x$20 + 1x$50 = 90 points).<br>
Given a record of every transaction during a three month period, calculate the reward points earned for each customer per month and total.<br>

### My Basic Solution(s)
#### Single Transaction
![picture description](https://github.com/razorwired1124/RewardsProgram/blob/master/Code%20Snippets/single_transaction.PNG)<br/><br/>
In the program shown above a customer enters the amount of there transaction and it tells them how many rewards points they will get.<br>
This program works for a single transaction at a time.<br><br>
Below are three 3 of code, each showing 1 of the 3 ranges.<br>
1. Below 50 (no rewards)<br>

2. Above 50 and below 100 (1 point for every dollar over 50)<br>

3. Above 100 (1 point for every dollar between 51-100 & 2 points for every dollar greater than 100)<br>

#### More Transactions(3 Months)

In the picture shown above you can see all of the very basic functions, loops and statements used in this program.<br><br>
The picture below shows the output for the above program<br>

### Ideas for Future Implementation
1. Write more intelligent code, and make it look cleaner.<br>
2. Use Python packages such as numpy and panda which are great for data manipulation, analysis, support for large multi-dimensional arrays, and high-level mathmatical functions<br>
3. Try using a different approach with a different language(s), such as using HTML, JavaScript, CSS, along with other web development tools. I think a nice clean dataset could be created using these resources<br>
4. Take more time to improve the basic functionality and feel of the program<br><br>
### Conclusion
In conclusion the very basics of this program where not extremely challenging, however with more time and effort I think that this project could look a lot nicer then in its current form.
